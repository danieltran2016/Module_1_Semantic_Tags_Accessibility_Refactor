# Module_1_Semantic_Tags_Accessibility_Refactor
First repo module for week 1 challenge 

User story: I want a webapage that is more accessible and user friendly for both users and programmers. As current, the html code is written with div tags that work, but it is not easy to see which parts control each page element. As a user i want to be able to easily read the page and understand its organization so that any modifications can be easily made and each element is clear to understand. 

Accpetance criteria: 
When the code is free of any div tags
Has semantic tags that match with the CSS file
the webpage works exactly as it did before with the div tags. 

Semantic tags are tags that are more descirptive and organized. They give the readers of the code a better idea of how the program is structured so that it is easier to understand, target errors or modify the code. Semantic tags are better for search engine optimization as well because it allows keywords to be searched and matched. This help with databases, searching and marketing becuase the keywords can be tagged and broadcasted to search engines like google, yahoo etc.
